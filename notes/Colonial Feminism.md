Yesterday I was reading #author/LilaAbu-Lughod’s article titled, *Do Muslim Women Really Need Saving? (Identity, Roles and Groups)* and I was struck by the term **colonial feminism** ([[When you conflate cultural symbols with symbols of oppression]]). She gave the example of how Laura Bush, in 2002 justified the invasion of Afghanistan as an attempt to *liberate women* from the clutches of the Taliban. Western feminists view the burqa and hijab as symbols of oppression ([In this article](https://republic.com.ng/october-november-2019/when-we-talk-of-freedom/) Hauwa Shaffii Nuhu explores the western and non-western ideas what it means to be free). But for some muslim women, that is far from the case. The burqa is a cultural symbol, one that signifies a mobile home for women in public spaces. Likewise, the hijab for many muslim women is very much hinged to their identities. During my undergraduate years, there was a student in my department who wore the burqa and in interacting with her I found that she was content in it. Mind you, she was in uni, studying the same course as me, attending the same classes as me. I know oppression can be layered, but her donning of the burqa did not symbolise oppression to me. I have a couple of female muslim friends that love wearing hijab. For them, hijab is the greatest manifestation of their ability to choose as muslim women. 

It has got me thinking of how Western feminism attributes cultural symbols to oppression, which boils down to justifications of colonialism: Europeans justified their conquest of African settlements by saying that Africa was a dark continent and needed to be saved, and needed salvation. But that is ethnocentrism (the feeling that one’s culture and beliefs supersedes others). Colonial feminism, by its nature is ethnocentric. Colonial feminism, ironically (okay maybe not), goes against the basic idea of feminism, choice of women to be whoever they want to be. 

Another problem with Colonial Feminism is that it conflates cultural symbols with the actions associated with cultural symbols. For example, the burqa isn’t a symbol of oppression, but the Taliban’s act of **forcing** women to wear it is oppressive. Restricting women from going to school and singing, erasing women from public face are all oppressive acts. So, rather than engage in the erosion of the symbols used to express a culture, rather than use those symbols to justify wars and conquests, criticise the oppressive actions associated with those symbols.
